			<p> Hi, my name is Dill! I like what I do and I do what I like. 
			The only times I don't like what I do is when I am comparing my stuff to other's successes.
			More likely than not, having a higher number doesn't always make you more successful or happy
			(wiether that be followers, reposts, or likes). At the end of the day, they are just numbers 
			on a screen you give importants to. Remember what you like and like what you do.</p>
