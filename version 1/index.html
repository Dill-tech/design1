		<h1>The Dada Manifesto</h1> <h2>By: TRISTAN TZARA</h2>
		<img src="dada.jpg" class= "image"/>
        <h3 class="imagecaption">Dada man!</h3>
			<p>If you find it futile and don't want to waste your time on a word that means nothing ... The
		first thought that comes to these people is bacteriological in character: to find its
		etymological, or at least its historical or psychological origin. We see by the papers that the
		Kru Negroes call the tail of a holy cow Dada. The cube and the mother in a certain district of
		Italy are called: Dada. A hobby horse, a nurse both in Russian and Rumanian: Dada. Some
		learned journalists regard it as an art for babies, other holy jesusescallingthelittlechildren of
		our day, as a relapse into a dry and noisy, noisy and monotonous primitivism. Sensibility is
		not constructed on the basis of a word; all constructions converge on perfection which is
		boring, the stagnant idea of a gilded swamp, a relative human product. A work of art should
		not be beauty in itself, for beauty is dead; it should be neither gay nor sad, neither light nor
		dark to rejoice or torture the individual by serving him the cakes of sacred aureoles or the
		sweets of a vaulted race through the atmospheres. A work of art is never beautiful by decree,
		objectively and for all. Hence criticism is useless, it exists only subjectively, for each man
		separately, without the slightest character of universality. Does anyone think he has found a
		psychic base common to all mankind?</p>
